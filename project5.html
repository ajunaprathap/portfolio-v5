          <p>He Rose Community Ministries (our client) is an Ugandan non-governmental organization founded in 2012. They aim to provide full
            community support to orphans, children living with HIV/AIDS and other vulnerable youth by providing them opportunities
            to pursue their education to become agents of social change. Their challenge was that their official
            website was not attracting enough donors and due to this, their
            junior school, where children get food and education, had to be closed. Therefore, He Rose aims to raise funds for the school and reopen
            the junior school as early as possible.<p>

                  <p>Since a website already existed, we judged that it would be useful to perform a
                    usability test on the old website to identify confusing navigation features and
                    roadblocks in the delivery of content. The purpose was to better understand
                    how the target users think and respond while using the website. This helped the team focus on the most important things to make a
                    real difference, and optimize the new site more efficiently. Each team member met with a
                    user to ask them questions about the previous redesign of the He Rose website. Comments from
                    the six users were gathered on a Miro board where we organized the feedback and suggestions from our usability tests</p>

                    team will need to build user trust by keeping the content of the website simple and concice.
                    The design team needed to tackle the tone issue on the website by using consistent brand colors and
                    visual hierarchy.</p>

                <h2 class="process-steps">Competitive Analysis</h2>
                  <p>We also conducted a competitive analysis on six websites:
                    Nyaka, Uganda Hands for Hope, Backup Uganda, IYF, Educate!, Unemployed Youth Africa. Following were our key takeaways:</p>
                    <p> 1. The competitive communities had a story/narrative around which the website was designed.</p>
                    <p> 2. There was a satisfactory sense of overall brand personality and visual design. </p>
                    <p> 3. Websites made use of strong icons and demographics to communicate/highlight key information. </p>
                    <p> 4. Information was strategically shared in an easy-to-consume manner. </p>
                    <p> 5. A design system was used to keep the website consistent. </p>
                    <p> 6. Relevant images were displayed that could emotionally resonate with users. </p>
                    <p>These analysis illustrated the need to source images from He Rose, reduce the amount of
                      text needed to be read, and further confirmed some of the pain points from our user tests.
                      From there, our team was ready to work on the branding tasks.</p>

                     of words that described the brand persona as per the product objectives.
                     These keywords were further shortlisted to define the brand accurately:
                     <strong> "Trustworthy, Helpful, Welcoming, Accountable, and Impactful." </strong></p>
                     <p>A similar exercise was conducted for typography where different fonts were paired, and the most suitable fonts were identified for the project.</p>
                     <p>The brand colours were also considered that aligned with the theme of the earlier website and expressed emotions such as care, honesty and trust. </p>

                 there were certain platform limitations we had to work with. From a previous

                 version of Weebly, which only includes basic access to customize website templates. This limited where
                 text could be placed as well as certain design choices.That said, we were still able to impliment most of the changes we wanted to make. </p>

                    testing to confirm the reduced pain points and determine if there were any additional
                    issues. Our team was excited to see that our efforts

                   <p>The newly found pain points were minor, and we addressed them
                   before our deadline. Each team member was assigned a checklist to confirm we had tackled everything
                   before our handoff to the client. The handoff consisted of final discussions and an internal
                   review of our work. After iterating from the second round of user testing, we saw future
                   improvements for the website. Our team decided to provide He Rose with recommendations for

             <p> Overall I enjoyed working on this project. I learned a lot about how to efficiently work in a collaborative environment. Also
               given the limited time and issues with time zones, it was important for us to focus on prioritizing the questions we had to ask our clients
                 while keeping in mind our deadline.
               Also, keeping strict deadlines for an iterative process helped the team focus on what was most important.
