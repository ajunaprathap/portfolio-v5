          <p>In today’s world cloud service is the best option to store data online. Currently there are multiple
           cloud storage apps available to users but most of these platforms have confusing task management solutions and cluttered dashboards.
           They lack simplicity and visibility when users try to create, organize and search for specific stored content.</p>

                  <p>Next, I collected and compared data of three of the top cloud file storing and sharing services
                    in the market today such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. Studying their
                  strengths and weaknesses helped me realize that all these products have pros and cons. Some of my key takeaways were:

                  <p>1. Google Drive has a user friendly design but its UI can be improved.</p>
                  <p>2. One Drive has a user friendly design and easy navigation but has a confusing file sharing process.</p>
                  <p>3. Dropbox has a very easy onboarding process as well as easy navigation, but it is designed to work with limited folders. It does not work well if you have several
                    folders that have to be synched.</p>
                  <p>4. Apart from this, I noticed that these three applications use similar icons and use blue as their primary color. Based on this I
                  decided to use a similar visual patterns in my app so my users could easily familiarise with my product.</p>

                   underwent several iteration and with each iteration I was able to improve the overall design.
                   Once the sketches were finalized, I converted them to digital wireframes and
                   created a prototype that was used for the first round of usability testing.

                     I changed the font of the logo text from Helvetica to Nunito so its rounded edges would match the curves of the cloud.
                     Other feebacks which I received from my usability test paticipants as well as senior designers and peers
                     varied from things such as adjusting the size and shapes of buttons,
                     improving the clarity of icons,  as well as tweaking my design to give it a more trendy look.</p>

                   <p>After spending several hours and days iterating the design,
                     the final feedback was extremely positve. During the final round of usability testing,
                     users noted the clean design and moved quickly through each task without pause. This helped me validate my design.
                     I understand the importance of constantly having another
                     set of eyes review my work and receiving critique and feedback to
                     produce the best results.</p>

             <p>With Your Space, I wanted to create a simple tool that users could
               easily navigate and use to save all files in one place. The lesson I learned during the project was the
               importance of a solid foundation. By putting time and effort to build well defined wireframes and mockups,
               it is much easier to work on more details in a prototype. Also I learned the importance of in-person usability testing,
               to be able to obtain feedback on issues critical to a product's viability and feasibility while still leaving enough room
               for exploratory tangents and unexpected insights.</p>
