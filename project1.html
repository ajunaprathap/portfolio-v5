          <p>In today’s world cloud service is the best option to store data online. Currently there are multiple
           cloud storage apps available to users but most of these platforms have confusing task management solutions and cluttered dashboards.
           They lack simplicity and visibility when users try to create, organize and search for specific stored content.</p>

          <p>Your Space aims to create a simple and intuitive user-friendly experience for users looking to create, upload, organize and share
           content with others. Users will not only be able to save any kind of content in one place but also create their
           own content, organize their files and share it with others.</p>

                   <p>I started my research with a survey posted amongst my social media contacts. My objective was to understand users'

                   underwent several iteration that helped improve the overall design. Once the sketches were finalized,
                   I converted them to digital wireframes and

                     better without its black outline. So I decided to modify my logo by removing the black outline as well as improving the shape of the cloud.
                      Other feebacks which I received from my usability test paticipants as well as senior designers and peers
                     varied from things such as adjusting the size and shapes of buttons,
                     improving the clarity of icons,  as well as tweaking my design to give it a more trendy look.</p>

                     the feedback was a breath of fresh air and resulted in my  “A HA” moments.
                     This process helped me understand the importance of constantly having another
                     set of eyes review my work and receiving critique and feedback to
                     produce the best results.</p>

             <p>Overall, I feel that following the design process helped me stay very focused and also improved the efficiency of my work. </p>
             <p>My biggest challenge here was to come up with a suitable layout for my design. Laying out the content in a way that could display
               all the features in a neat and organized way, at the same time making sure the screens are not getting too cluttered was tricky.</p>
             <p>My second challenge was deciding on my brand color , logo and typefaces. Coming up with a suitable name and symbol that would not
                 only represent my brand but that would also relate to my brands purpose was a big challenge.</p>
             <p>The usability testing helped me realize that some of the features like big size of add button, certain text representations, etc., that
                I had added in my design thinking it would make my design more user friendly, actually did not have the desired effect on real users.
                But instead several suggestions provided to me by my users actually helped me improve my design.</p>
