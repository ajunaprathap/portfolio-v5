         <h2 class="process">Problem</h2>
          <p>In today’s world cloud service is the most suitable option to store data online digitally. Currently there are multiple
           cloud storage apps available to users but most of these platforms have confusing task management solutions and cluttered dashboards.
           They lack simplicity and visibility when users try to create, organize and search for specific stored content.</p>
         <h2 class="process">Solution</h2>
          <p>Your Space aims to create a simple and intuitive user-friendly experience for users looking to create, upload, organize and share
           content with others. Users will not only have the ability to save any kind of content, all in one place but can also create their
           own content, organize their files and share it with others.</p>

            <section class="user-survey">

                  <h2 class="process-steps">User Survey</h2>
                  <p>I started my research with a survey posted online to multiple media platforms, public forums and email contacts. I wanted to understand
                   what people were looking for in a cloud file-storage and sharing application. I also wanted to understand their frustrations and what they
                   currently use for storing information online.</p>
                  <h3>By analysing the results of my user survey I understood that:</h3>
                    <ul class="indent">
                      <li>The ability to save information was the feature that users liked the most </li>
                      <li>70% users felt that being able to upload content from the web or their mobile was important to them</li>
                      <li>65% users felt that being able to create content was important to them </li>
                      <li>55% users felt that being able to organize the data they saved was very useful</li>
                      <li>To 70% of my participants being able to share or collaborate with others was important</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h3>When asked what they disliked the most about the current tools they said:</h3>
                    <ul class="indent">
                      <li>“ Difficulty in organizing content “</li>
                      <li>“ Difficulty to access stored documents ”</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h3>The features users felt could be improved or added were:</h3>
                    <ul class="indent">
                      <li>Ability to search storage for specific stored content</li>
                      <li>Ability to manage/organize data</li>
                      <li>Simple, straightforward and fun looking UI</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h3>What I learned from the research:</h3>
                    <p>The user survey helped me understand that users are benefited by cloud storage services and they are in need of an application
                         that would help them perform the following tasks intuitively:</p>
                    <ol class="indent">
                      <li>Save content that has been uploaded or created</li>

                      <li>Share and Collaborate with others</li>
                      <li>Search storage</li>

                   <p>At this point I had a better idea of who my target audience were, so based on this I created two user personas.</p>

              <h2 class="process-steps">Competitive Analysis</h2>
                 <p>I then started to look at some of the top cloud services on the market today like Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive to study their
                 strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. I realized that all these products have their own pros and cons. Example, Dropbox
                 has a very simple and user friendly interface but the low visibility of file types on their dashboard is frustrating.
                 Similarly Google Drive has a very simple and intuitive design but there is no way to keep track of the files users have shared
                 in the past. In case of OneDrive, OneDrive has a very confusing file sharing process. These were all opportunities I saw for my product.
                 Apart from these, I also noticed that all three of them used similar iconography and also had blue as their primary color. So for my product I
                 decided to use a similar visual pattern so that my users could easily familiarise with my product.</p>

                 <p>My next step was to create wireframes so that I could visualize all the abstract ideas and concepts that had been outlined so far.
                   For this I initially sketched few layouts for my design. Several iterations were made to my initial sketches to improve my design.
                   Once my sketches were finalized I quickly converted them to digital wireframes using the Figma tool. </p>

                     <li>After signing up into the account users were confused because they expected to see an empty dashboard and not a
                     prefilled one because they were signing up for the first time and were not returning users.</li>
                     <li>For the task were users had to upload a photo, though they were able to complete the task without any confusion,
                     after completing the task they felt that including the names of the the files, folders, pictures etc would have helped
                     them identify their files more easily.</li>

                     <p>After updating my design based on the results of the usability testing, I then proceeded to work on my branding.
                       For this I started by trying to come up with a suitable name for my product. After a lot of brainstorming I decided on the
                       name “Your Space” for my product because this name was very simple and easy to remember and it could immediately convey the
                       message to the users that the product was giving them “their own space” in cloud where they could backup their data and use it
                       any way they want.</p>

                     <p>Once I had decided on the name for my product, my next thought was about how I could display this name and how my logo was going to be.
                       For that I created several sketches which I continued to iterate until I finally decided on a logo which was perfect for my product.</p>

                   <p>During the preference test, my users preferred the icon of a person with a “+” sign as the share icon, they liked the button with create

                     better without its black outline. Other feebacks that I received varied from things such as adjusting the size and shapes of buttons,
                     improving the clarity of icons,  as well as tweaking my design to give it a more trendy look.</p>

                     <p>After spending several hours and days producing the reviewed design, the feedback was a breath of fresh air and resulted in my  “A HA” moments.
                       This process helped me understand the importance of constantly having another set of eyes review my work and receiving critique and feedback to
                       produce the best results.</p>

             <p>Overall, I feel that following the design process helped me stay very focused and also improved the efficiency of my work. </p>
             <p>My biggest challenge here was to come up with a suitable layout for my design. laying out the content in a way that could display
               all the features in a neat and organized way, at the same time making sure the screens are not getting too cluttered was tricky.</p>
             <p>My second challenge was deciding on my brand color , logo and typefaces. Coming up with a suitable name and symbol that would not
                 only represent my brand but that would also relate to my brands purpose was a big challenge.</p>
             <p>The usability testing helped me realize that some of the features ( Eg: big size of add button, certain text representations etc) that
                I had added in my design thinking it would make my design more user friendly, actually did not have the desired effect on real users.
                But instead several suggestions provided to me by my users actually helped me improve my design.</p>
