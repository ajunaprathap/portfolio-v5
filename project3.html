         <h2 class="process center-align">Problem</h2>
          <p>The retail industry is constantly changing and there are always new challenges in
            this competitive industry. Online retailers are spending a significant amount of money
            driving traffic to their online store. Existing research has shown that acquiring a new
            customer can cost five times more than retaining an existing customer. That’s why in this
            competitive landscape, online retailers need to find ways to convert existing customers into
            repeat customers to increase ecommerce sales.
          </p>
         <h2 class="process center-align">Solution</h2>
          <p>To solve this problem, I created a design that focussed on highlighting the needs of these
            existing customers and addressing their problems thus motivating them to keep coming back for
            repeated purchases and reducing the frequency of cart abandonment.

                   <h2 class="process-steps">User Interviews</h2>
                   <p>I conducted in-person interviews with online shoppers to get answers to three questions:</p>
                     <ol class="survey-highlights">
                       <li> What motivated them to make another online purchase from the same site/app?</li>
                       <li> What challenges do they face when trying to make an online purchase?</li>
                       <li> What are the reasons for cart abandonment?</li>
                     </ol>

                   <h3 class="sub-heading">User Interview Results</h3>
                      <ul class="survey-highlights">
                        <li>Online shoppers are motivated to make another purchase if they find coupons,
                          discounts, deals, promotions and benefits</li>
                        <li>They love shopping in apps/sites that are easy to navigate</li>
                        <li>Their main frustration is the difficulty in searching and finding a
                          specific product</li>
                        <li>They also find it difficult to judge the quality of products just
                          by looking at pictures & description</li>
                        <li>They find it difficult to decide if multiple varieties of a product exists</li>
                        <li>They get frustrated when they are not able to get help quickly</li>
                        <li>They get frustrated when they can’t easily get information about the return policy</li>
                        <li>They find it difficult to predict the exact arrival date of their package</li>
                        <li>They don’t appreciate last minute surprises e.g., increase in the final
                          cost due to shipping charges</li>
                      </ul>
                   <p class="add-padding-top-survey">From this data I got a better understanding of
                     existing customers' challenges & frustrations and the reasons why they abandoned

               <h2 class="process-steps center-align-exception">Competitive Analysis</h2>
                  <p>Then, I studied two of my competitors Amazon and Wayfair. While Amazon
                    provided users with a lot of selection and great benefits, their UI is
                    cluttered and they do not categorize their products clearly which made it difficult
                    for users to find specific products quickly. Users also found it difficult to judge
                    the quality of products just by looking at pictures and videos.  Instead they had to
                    rely on reviews written by other customers. In the case of Wayfair, products are
                    well categorized and the site is very intuitive, however, many users complain that the items they
                    receive do not match the pictures in the product page. To rectify this problem Wayfair
                    has incorporated AR features in their site, but this is limited to only a few products
                    and hence not helpful in all cases.</p>

                   <p>With a better understanding of my users' needs and their challenges,
                     I moved forward with creating user stories to capture product features and functionalities.</p>

                    the users need to do in order to complete each task, but also deliver
                    the experience in the most effective manner possible.</p>

                   <p>Once I organised all the insights I gained from the research phase, I began to design the app.
                     First, I began to sketch several of the site’s main screens using my user flows as a guide.</p>
                     <p>While sketching the homepage I mainly focused on providing a personalized experience to
                       existing customers. I also focused on providing features that could motivate them to make another
                       purchase (e.g., showing users current deals & discounts, letting them know if their favorite
                       items are on sale etc.,). </p>
                     <p>Also, in addition to the regular search bar option, I provided a visual search feature that
                       could help customers to easily search for specific products. </p>
                     <p>Next, I focused on keeping all products well organized to make the search easy. </p>
                     <p>When sketching the product page I also focused on showing all the information that was needed
                       to help customers make a decision. </p>
                     <p>I also provided an Augmented Reality feature to help customers see how the product
                       would look on a real person. </p>
                     <p>Finally, in the cart page I provided options for customers to view and apply available promo codes.</p>

                   <h2 class="process-steps"> Usability Testing</h2>
                   <p>During usability testing of the high-fidelity prototype,
                     test participants were asked to select a product they were interested in
                     buying from the catalog page. Though participants did not have any confusion
                     in making a selection, they felt that adding more details about the product such
                     as shipping charges, estimated package arrival date, etc., on the catalog page rather
                     than on the product page would save them a lot of time when making a selection.
                     Based on this suggestion, I made necessary changes to the design
                     by adding relevant product information that could help customers take decisions easily.</p>

             <p> Overall I enjoyed working on this project. I learned a lot about the retail industry and an e-commerce UX.
               My biggest takeaway was understanding how small design changes can make a huge difference in
               the way users perceive a design.
