         <h2 class="process center-align">Problem</h2>
          <p>With increase in the number of people identifying themselves with one or more dietary restrictions,
            finding a  restaurant that fits a person’s diet is a major challenge and can be frustrating.
            This is because most of the food centric apps provide very few dietary restriction filters
            even if a restaurants menu may have more options.  For instance, an app will only have vegan
            or gluten free filters but may not have filters such as vegetarian, halal and kosher.
            Also, most restaurants that identify themselves as “diet friendly” may not have many food
            items for a specific dietary preference which may be misleading.
          </p>
         <h2 class="process center-align">Solution</h2>
          <p>Choiz is an app that can help users explore restaurants
            based on their dietary restrictions. Users can just select their
            diet and enter their location to get a list of restaurants that meet
            their dietary preference. Users will be able to distinctly see the list
            of food items in a restaurant's menu that meet their dietary needs thus
            skipping the frustrating task of going through the entire menu to find the
            right food option. Once users find the right food option, they will also be
            able to make reservations or have their food delivered or available for pickup.

                     centric apps available today. I also wanted to understand additional

                  <p>I then did a competitive analysis on three of my competitors Yelp,
                    Happy Cow and Uber Eats to evaluate their strategies and identify their
                    strengths and weaknesses. Some of my key takeaways were:</p>

                      <p> 1. Yelp and UberEats have a very simple and user friendly UI,
                        but does not allow users to make a selection based on dietary restrictions.</p>
                      <p> 2. Happy cow has a friendly logo design and easy navigation. It  also allows users
                        to find food based on their diet. However its pages are too colorful and distracting.
                        Another limitation with Happy Cow is that it only provides vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free filters. </p>

                   During the first round of usability testing users were asked to complete the following

                 <h2 class="process-steps">Brand Story</h2>
                 <p> During the branding phase, I wanted my product to not only have a catchy
                   name but also a name that's related to my brand's purpose.  Since the main purpose
                   of my app was to help people find the right food options easily, I wanted my brand
                   name to easily convey this message to users. After exploring several options, I decided
                   to settle on the name “CHOIZ” as the name was simple and catchy and represented the main
                   theme of my app that users always have a “choice” when it comes to their dietary preferences.</p>
                <p>The next step was to choose the right logo. For this I started by initially sketching a
                  few logo ideas on paper. Then, I created digital versions of my sketches to get a better feel
                  of the logo before finally settling on a logo design that was perfect for my brand.</p>

               <h2 class="process-steps color-center">Color</h2>
                <p>I decided to go with green as my primary color mainly because green is a
                  color that promotes the feeling of abundance. Considering my app provides people
                  with dietary needs more options to the food of their choice, green was the apt choice.
                  Also green is associated with energy, health, freshness, wellness and safety, thereby
                  giving my app a fresh and reliable feel. </p>

                    I used Montserrat for the H1 text and Source sans Pro for the body text.

                   <p>Next I created a prototype that was used for the second round of usability testing.
                     This time I asked my users to mainly focus on the visuals and the UI elements as I wanted to test my branding.
                     Below are two examples of the test results:</p>
                     <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
                      <p><b> Result 1: </b>For the task to ‘rate and write a review’, users were confused
                        where most users clicked on the stars instead of the review link. In order to reduce this confusion,
                        I removed the stars and provided additional text in the link.</p>
                      <p><b>Result 2: </b>In the restaurant detail screen, users felt that the sub-navbar looked different
                        from the rest of the design, so I improved this section by using icons instead of sub-navbar.</p>

               <p class="paragraph-holder paragraph-holder-center">After updating my design based on the results of the usability testing,
                 I had my final design reviewed by my team members at the Thinkful community and my mentor. The feedback I received from them
                 was invaluable. Also, focusing on what users wanted from Choiz and letting them influence the overall design made the app a
                 user friendly, intuitive and an impactful product.</p>

             <p>I think my biggest takeaway from this project was realizing the importance of conducting
               usability tests as well as preference tests at every stage of my process. This helped me
               save time as well as helped improve the design. I also learned how to implement modern
               practices and techniques to create great experiences for users.</p>
