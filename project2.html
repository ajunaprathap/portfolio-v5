         <h2 class="process center-align">Problem</h2>
          <p>Finding restaurants that cater to your dietary restrictions is always difficult since
            most of the apps that exist today only provide limited filter options such as just vegan or vegetarian
             and this is not very useful to people who are on other kinds of dietary restrictions. Also, most restaurants that mark
            themselves as “diet friendly” usually only have salads or bland pasta as an option. With the rise in the number of
            people identifying themselves with at least one kind of dietary restriction, trying to find restaurants that fit
            their diet is a major frustration.</p>
         <h2 class="process center-align">Solution</h2>
          <p>Choiz is an app that can help users explore restaurants near them that have food options that are specific to their diet.
            All they have to do is select their diet and enter their location information to see a list
            of restaurants near them that have food options for them. The app will display food from the
            menu that is specific to the users selected dietary preference, thus skipping the frustrating task of having to skim
            through the entire menu to find an option. Users can also read reviews, make reservations or have their food delivered or ready for pickup.</p>

                   <h2 class="process-steps">User Survey</h2>
                   <p>I started my research with a survey posted online to multiple media platforms,
                      public forums and email contacts. I wanted to understand what frustrations people
                      with diet restrictions faced when searching for food using the current apps.
                      I also wanted to know what it was that they were looking forward to in an app that
                      would help them find food based on their diet.</p>
                   <h3 class="sub-heading">User Survey Analysis</h3>
                      <ul class="survey-highlights">
                        <li><span style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:bold">60.7%</span> participants said that they had some kind of dietary restriction / dietary preference</li>
                        <li><span style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:bold">62.1%</span> participants said that online reviews and rating was the most important thing they considered when choosing which restaurant they wanted to dine in.  </li>
                        <li><span style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:bold">82.4%</span>  participants said that they checked restaurant menus online before going to any restaurant</li>
                        <li><span style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:bold">52.5%</span> participants said that not being able to identify which restaurants had food options for them was frustrating</li>
                        <li><span style="font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:bold">70%</span> participants said that they ordered food for delivery/pickup atleast once a month</li>
                      </ul>
                   <p class="add-padding-top-survey">When asked about their frustrations, they said that most of the restaurant menus did not highlight food items
                     for people with dietary restrictions. Secondly, they were also finding it very difficut to identify which restaurants had food options for them.With this information,
                     I felt confident to move forward with developing the concept of Choiz.</p>

                   <p>At this point though I had a better idea of who my target audience were, I interviewed survey
                     respondents to dig deeper into their responses and clarify my understanding of
                     the problem and my potential solution. So based on this I created three user personas.</p>

              <div class="paragraph-holder paragraph-holder-center">
               <h2 class="process-steps center-align-exception">Competitive Analysis</h2>
                  <p>Since there are many restaurant search engines and apps already in the market,
                   I took a closer look at three of my competitors : Yelp, Happy Cow and Uber Eats
                   to see what their positions were in the market so that I could identify where these apps were falling short for users.</p>
                  <p>From the SWOT analysis I understood that all three services have their own pros and cons, for example,
                    all of them have a simple and user friendly UI, but Yelp and UberEats don't allow their users to make a
                    selection based on dietary restrictions. Similarly though Happy cow has a friendly logo
                    design and also allows users find food based on their diet, its disadvantage is that its pages are too colorful and distracting
                    and also it provided only limited filter options such as vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free filters. These were opportunities that I saw for my product.

                 <h2 class="process-steps">Brand Story</h2>
                 <p> When I got to the branding phase, I wanted this product to not only have a catchy name but to
                   also have a name that's related to my brand's purpose.  Since the main purpose of my app was to
                   help people find the right food options easily, I wanted my brand name to easily convey this message
                   to my users. Through proper mind-mapping I decided to settle on the name CHOIZ for my app because this
                   name clearly lets the users know that my app was to going to help them choose food based on their diet.
                   </p>
                <p>The next thing I had to decide was my logo. For this I started by initially sketching a few logo ideas on paper.
             Then I created digital versions of my sketches to get a better feel of the logo before finally settling on a logo design that was perfect for my brand.</p>

                <p>I decided to go with green as my primary color mainly because green is a color that promotes the feeling of abundance.
                  It is a color that's also associated with energy, health, freshness, wellness and safety and since my app was mainly
                  concerned with providing food options, I felt that this color was perfect for my brand. </p>

                     <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
                      <p><b> Result 1: </b>For the task where users had to rate and write a review, they were very confused.
                           Most users clicked on the stars instead of the link. To reduce this confusion, I removed the stars and made the link clearer.</p>
                      <p><b>Result 2: </b>In the restaurant detail screen, users felt that the sub-navbar looked different from the rest of the design,
                        so I improved this section by using icons instead. </p>

                 I had my final design reviewed by my team members at the Thinkful community. The feedback I received from them,
                 as well as my mentor was invaluable. Also, focusing on what users wanted from Choiz and
                 letting them influence the overall design made Choiz a user friendly tool that is intuitive and impactful. </p>

             <p>I think my biggest takeaway from this project was realizing the importance of conducting
               usability tests as well as preference tests at every stage of my process. This helped me save time as well as helped me improve
               the design. I also learned how to implement modern practices and techniques to elevate my designs.</p>
