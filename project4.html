               Ride is a day trip planner app that automatically creates trip plans for users based on their needs. The goal of this
               app is to help people plan day trips quickly and easily without having to spend hours on the planning process.</p>

         <h2 class="process center-align">Problem</h2>
          <p>Going on a day trip is always fun. But do we always get enough time to plan our trip ?
            No, Not always! Planning trips can be challenging and stressful, especially if you only have limited
            time and budget. A person who wants to plan a day trip feels overwhelmed by the number of suggestions
            he or she finds online. There is a need to consolidate and present this information such that one can
            quickly decide the places to visit without spending hours on the trip planning process.
          </p>
         <h2 class="process center-align">Solution</h2>
          <p>I designed a day trip planner app that focuses on
             addressing the current problems of users and helping them plan their day trips without spending too much time and effort.

                   <h2 class="process-steps">User Interviews</h2>
                   <p>I started my research by conducting an online survey to better
                     understand my end users. My focus was to understand the frustrations and challenges faced by people
                   who were trying to plan a day trip.</p>

                   <p>Next I created a user persona where I highlighted a user's goals and frustrations

                  <p>Next, I analyzed three of my competitors, Google Maps, Tripadvisor and Expedia. While Google Maps
                    provides a list of places to visit nearby, it is difficult to create a plan that optimizes time and
                    distance of the trip. In the case of Tripadvisor, though they provide a list of places,
                    planning a trip with the information provided is confusing as well as time taking.
                     Expedia focuses mainly on hotels and travel bookings and not short duration trips. </p>

                  <p> Next, I created user flows to define the various steps a user would take. Not only did this allow me to focus on what
                    the users needed in order to complete each task, but it also helped me deliver
                    the user experience in the most effective manner possible.</p>

                  <p>Once I captured and prioritized all the insights from the research phase, I began to design the app.
                    First, I sketched several of the site’s main screens using my user flows as a guide.</p>
                    <p>My main goal was to provide users with multiple trip plans optimized for travel time and distance between locations. With this goal, I created a design where the app automatically
                      generates a plan from scratch based on inputs from ther user.

                      While sketching the homepage I mainly focused on providing an easy way to help users understand
                      the various day trip plans generated by the app.

                     Next, I decided to go with orange as my primary color and Cyan as my secondary color
                     as these two colors promote the feelings of excitement, energy, enthusiasm, relaxation, and happiness and gives users a vacation feel.
                      These were the feelings I wanted to invoke in my users while using this app. While selecting the typography, I decided to go with 'Robot'
                    because this typeface is compact and easy to read.</p>
